                                What are omega-3 fatty acids, and why do I need them?

                                <p>
                                    Omega-3 fatty acids are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. They are building blocks of every living cell in the human body and required for optimal function of the cells. If you are not currently consuming at least two meals of fatty fish per week,
                                    you may benefit from a supplement rich in EPA and DHA
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                I have heard that fat is bad for you. How can omega-3 fatty acids be good for you?
                              </strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    There are good and not-so-good fats. If a label indicates hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, that ingredient is an unsaturated fat that has undergone a chemical process called hydrogenation to turn it into saturated fat and trans fat. These
                                    hydrogenated fats are most often found in packaged foods such as pastries, cookies, and margarine.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Saturated fats are found in animal-based foods like meat, butter, and cheese. Saturated fats are not "bad" for you but a high intake of saturated fats as compared to poly- and monounsaturated fats is associated with an increased risk of some diseases.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But some "good fats" like omega-3 fatty acids contribute to health and normal cell development. They're building blocks of every living cell in your body. A cell membrane made with building blocks that come primarily from saturated fat has a different
                                    structure and is less fluid than one that incorporates more omega-3 fatty acids. This loss of fluidity makes it difficult for the cell to carry out its normal functions and increases the cell's susceptibility to injury
                                    and death.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Omega-3 fatty acids are abundant in ocean fish, but many people in North America don't eat a lot of fish and may need more omega-3 fatty acids than their present diets provide.
                                </p>

                                Are there any adverse drug interactions with omega 3s? 
                              </strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    Omega 3s from fish oil like those in Nutrilite® Balanced Health Omega supplements have been shown to be safe if your total dietary daily intake (including food) does not exceed 3 grams. Daily intake of dietary supplements of omega 3 should not exceed
                                    2 grams. Generally speaking, if you have no difficulties eating ocean fish, supplementation with omega 3 from fish oil should present no adverse effects at levels of 2 grams or less.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Certain medications may interact with omega-3 fatty acids. These drug interactions include aspirin, anticoagulants, Warfarin (coumadin), and other medications that alter blood coagulation. If you are taking any of these medications, please consult your
                                    physician before adding an omega-3 supplement to your diet. It is always important to tell your pharmacist or health care professional that you are taking any supplement, including those made from concentrated fish
                                    oil. And if you notice any changes in your physical health while taking the supplements, you should also contact your health care provider. This is especially important for children under 12 years of age, pregnant or
                                    nursing women, or anyone with a medical condition.

                                What is the difference between EPA and DHA?
                              </strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    Omega-3 fatty acids are important to every cell in your body and must be obtained from the diet for good health. Our bodies use omega 3s to form the outer cell structure. EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are two of the most important
                                    omega 3s.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Research suggests that EPA benefits the heart and circulatory system by promoting normal lipid levels and blood flow. EPA also plays a role in the natural movement of joints.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Evidence shows DHA is an important building block of the brain, nerves, and eyes. DHA is the most highly unsaturated fatty acid found in nature. DHA supports normal mental function, optimal memory, focus, and learning. In fetuses and infants, DHA is critical
                                    for brain and vision development.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The average American diet contains less than 200 milligrams of the important omega 3s EPA and DHA. Japan, England, and several European countries have set Recommended Daily Allowances for omega 3s, but there are none in the U.S. yet.

                                I take a multivitamin every day. Do I need an omega-3 or glucosamine supplement as well?

                                <p>
                                    Multivitamins provide nutritional insurance to help you and your family fill the nutritional gaps between what you actually eat and what you should eat. However, most multivitamins do not contain any omega-3 fatty acids, and many people in North America
                                    are not getting enough omega 3s. If you are not eating ocean fish at least twice a week, you may benefit from omega-3 supplements. Most multivitamins don't contain any glucosamine either, and if you are concerned about
                                    your joint health, you may benefit from a glucosamine supplement.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It is always a good idea to eat whole foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and ocean fish is the best source. But if you don't eat ocean fish at least twice a week, Nutrilite® omega-3 supplements can help you get the important EPA and DHA that might be
                                    missing from your diet.
